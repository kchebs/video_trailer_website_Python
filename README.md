# video_trailer_website_Python_HTML

To view the result of the Python code, simply view "great_movies.html." To recreate the great_movies.html file, run entertainment_center.py which in turn imports media.py and website_creator.py. Website_creator references online CSS files and the included CSS file titled "modified_bootstrap-theme.min.css."

Goal: To write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL, and then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.
