# video_trailer_website_Python_HTML

The goal of this project was to write server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL, and then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.


To view the result of the Python code, simply view "great_movies.html." To recreate the great_movies.html file, run entertainment_center.py which in turn imports media.py and website_creator.py. Website_creator references online CSS files and the included CSS file titled "modified_bootstrap-theme.min.css." To run the code you need Python, preferrably version 3+, and a web browser, like Chrome or Safari, to view the outputted HTML file. To edit the code, you can simply use a text editor. However, I used PyCharm and Atom. These software dependencies can be easily downloaded for free on the internet.
